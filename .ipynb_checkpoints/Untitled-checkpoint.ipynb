    "So, when we are learning \"sentences\" (like, for example, in sentiment analysis), we don't care only about the words as separate units, but also about the context. The meaning of a word might change depending on the previous or the next word or words. It sounds like we want something similar with our SMILES, we don't care only about an atom, or a character, in the SMILE, we care about the context. One of the techniques for predicting categories based on analyzing words and it context is using Recurrent Neural Netwoks (For a little overview about RNN and how they work, I read this [article](https://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/?fbclid=IwAR3hdJeXQV9_I1fHGlFNuB_pK5pcQX8lc-T0NPOMjt87gDITH3Mw-fJXSow) from Andrej Karpathy, who is the director of artificial intelligence and Autopilot Vision at Tesla and he specializes in deep learning and image recognition and understanding).\n",
